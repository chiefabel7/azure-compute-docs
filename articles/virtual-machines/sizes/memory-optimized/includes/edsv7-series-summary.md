Edsv7-series virtual machines run on the 6th Generation Intel@ Xeon® processor (Granite Rapids) processor reaching an all-core turbo clock speed of 3.6 GHz with a max turbo frequency is 4.2 GHz. This new processor features [Intel&reg; Turbo Boost Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [Intel&reg; Advanced-Vector Extensions 512 (Intel&reg; AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html), and [Intel&reg; Advanced Matrix Extensions](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/accelerator-engines/advanced-matrix-extensions/overview.html). These virtual machines offer up to 372 vCPU and 2,825 GiB of RAM as well as fast, local SSD storage up to 3x7040 GiB. Edsv7- series virtual machines provide better performance for most general-purpose workloads compared to the prior generation with better networking and remote storage performance, upgraded CPU performance, elevated memory bandwidth, faster NVMe local storage access, increased scalability, and larger local storage capacity. Edsv7-series virtual machines are ideal for memory-intensive workloads, such as SQL and noSQL database servers, data analytics engines, data warehousing workloads, business intelligence applications, in-memory databases such as SAP and Redis, and in-memory analytics and more.

Edsv7-series virtual machines offer local storage disks. You can attach Standard SSDs, Standard HDDs, Premium SSDs, and Premium SSD V2 disk storage to these virtual machines. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.
