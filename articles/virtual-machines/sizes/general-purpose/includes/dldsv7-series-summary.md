# Customer intent: As a cloud architect, I want to evaluate Dldsv6-series virtual machines, so that I can determine their suitability for cost-effective deployment of non-memory intensive applications.

Dldsv7-series virtual machines run on the 6th Generation Intel@ XeonÂ® processor (Granite Rapids)processor reaching an all-core turbo clock speed of 3.6 GHz. This new processor features [Intel&reg; Turbo Boost Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [Intel&reg; Advanced-Vector Extensions 512 (Intel&reg; AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html), and [Intel&reg; Advanced Matrix Extensions](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/accelerator-engines/advanced-matrix-extensions/overview.html). These virtual machines offer up to 248 vCPU and 496 GiB of RAM as well as fast, local SSD storage up to 8x1760 GiB. These virtual machine sizes can reduce cost when running non-memory intensive applications.

Dldsv7-series virtual machines support Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.
