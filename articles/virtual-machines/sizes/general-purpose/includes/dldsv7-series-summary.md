Dldsv7-series virtual machines run on the Intel® Xeon® 6973P-C (Granite Rapids) processor reaching an all-core turbo clock speed of 3.6 GHz with a max turbo frequency is 4.2 GHz. This new processor features [Intel&reg; Turbo Boost Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [Intel&reg; Advanced-Vector Extensions 512 (Intel&reg; AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html), and [Intel&reg; Advanced Matrix Extensions](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/accelerator-engines/advanced-matrix-extensions/overview.html). These virtual machines offer up to 248 vCPU and 496 GiB of RAM as well as fast, local SSD storage up to 8x1760 GiB. Dldsv7-series virtual machines provide better performance compared to the prior generation with better increased networking, increased remote storage performance, upgraded CPU performance, elevated memory bandwidth, faster NVMe local storage access, increased scalability, and larger local storage capacity. These virtual machine sizes can reduce cost when running non-memory intensive applications. Dldsv7-series virtual machines are ideal for many general computing workloads such as e-commerce systems, web applications, desktop virtualization solutions, application servers, and more.

Dldsv7-series virtual machines support Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.
