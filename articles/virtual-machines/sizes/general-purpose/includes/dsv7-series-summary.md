# Customer intent: "As a cloud architect, I want to compare the Dsv6-series virtual machines with previous generations, so that I can determine the best option for upgrading our general-purpose workloads while optimizing performance and cost."

Dsv7-series virtual machines run on the Intel® Xeon® 6 6973P-C (Granite Rapids) processor reaching an all-core turbo clock speed of 3.6 GHz with a max turbo frequency is 4.2 GHz. This new processor features [Intel&reg; Turbo Boost Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [Intel&reg; Advanced-Vector Extensions 512 (Intel&reg; AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html), and [Intel&reg; Advanced Matrix Extensions](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/accelerator-engines/advanced-matrix-extensions/overview.html). These virtual machines offer up to 372 vCPU and 1488 GiB of RAM. Dsv7-series virtual machines provide better performance compared to the prior generation with better networking and remote storage performance, upgraded CPU peformance, and elevated memory bandwidth. Dsv7-series virtual machines are ideal for many general computing workloads such as e-commerce systems, web applications, desktop virtualization solutions, application servers, and more.

Dsv7-series virtual machines don't have any temporary storage thus lowering the price of entry. You can attach Standard SSDs, Standard HDDs, Premium SSDs, and Premium SSD V2 disk storage to these virtual machines. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.
