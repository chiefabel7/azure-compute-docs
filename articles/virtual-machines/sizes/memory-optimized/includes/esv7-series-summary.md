Esv7-series virtual machines run on the 6th Generation Intel@ XeonÂ® processor (Granite Rapids) processor reaching an all-core turbo clock speed of 3.6 GHz. This new processor features [Intel&reg; Turbo Boost Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [Intel&reg; Advanced-Vector Extensions 512 (Intel&reg; AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html), and [Intel&reg; Advanced Matrix Extensions](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/accelerator-engines/advanced-matrix-extensions/overview.html). These virtual machines offer up to 372 vCPU and 2,825 GiB of RAM. Esv7-series virtual machines are ideal for memory-intensive workloads, such as relational database servers, large databases, data analytics engines, in-memory caches, and more.
