# Customer intent: As a cloud architect, I want to evaluate Dlsv6-series virtual machines, so that I can determine if their specifications and cost-effectiveness meet the needs of my non-memory intensive applications.

Dlsv7-series virtual machines run on 6th Generation Intel@ XeonÂ® 6 processor (Granite Rapids) CPU processor reaching an all-core turbo clock speed of 3.6 GHz. This new processor 
features [Intel&reg; Turbo Boost Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), 
[Intel&reg; Advanced-Vector Extensions 512 (Intel&reg; AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html), 
and [Intel&reg; Advanced Matrix Extensions](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/accelerator-engines/advanced-matrix-extensions/overview.html). 
These virtual machines offer up to 128 vCPU and 256 GiB of RAM. These virtual machine sizes can reduce cost when running non-memory intensive applications.

Dlsv7-series virtual machines don't have any temporary storage thus lowering the price of entry. You can attach Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types. 
You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.
